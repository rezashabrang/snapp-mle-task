    "One solution that comes to mind is to find the center of the place and then set a radius for example 100 meters and filter the points from the rides using this and then perform clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a princial flaw to this method: The circle we choose as boundary may not contain relevent points or worst case any points at all depending on the structure of the place.\n",

    "<small>Bad Boundary Example. The center is outside the building structure itself.</small>\n",
    "\n",
    "We may increase the 100 meters radius mentioned but this may lead to finding extra points that not relevent to that specific place, like if two malls are close to each other if the defined radius threshold is too high the boundary of one mall may contain points from other mall (Near San'at square exists several malls that are near each other like Setin, Milad Noor and Lidoma) and that leads to error in clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also some points that are inside of the building gets included by this approach (entrances are not placed inside a place).\n",
    "As you see this method will not work for this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what other options do we have?\n",
    "\n",
    "How about choosing points that reside at the boundries of the place with a certain distance (Buffered Polygon)?\n",
    "This is a more intuitive and logical approach as it is shape-agnostic and does not depened on the structure of the building. Also it reduces the chance of overlapping for places that are near each other (This of course needs a good distance value from polygon boundaries and is a heuristic that needs to be calculated carefully).\n",
    "Another merit of this approach is that it does not contain the points inside of the building.<br>\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b> By looking at the points visualization there are not many points inside of a building and these can probably be removed using outlier detection methods, but this is prone to error and buffered polyon can be assumed as a safer and more accurate approach.\n",
